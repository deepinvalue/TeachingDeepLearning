# TeachingDeepLearning

## Description
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources used for teaching deep learning concepts. It's aimed at assisting students to grasp the fundamental principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning through practical examples, code implementation, and interactive coding sessions.

## Contents
- `01_Intro_to_DL_with_Keras.ipynb`: This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to ML/DL, covering the environment setup and basic concepts. It guides through the process of building, training, and refining deep learning models using `Keras` with `TensorFlow` as the backend. Key topics include:
  - Data preprocessing and exploratory visualization using datasets from `sklearn`.
  - Construction of neural network models using various Keras APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Model Subclassing.
  - Techniques to mitigate overfitting in deep learning models, including data scaling, dropout, and early stopping.
  - Evaluation of model performance on a test dataset.

## How to Use
To utilize these notebooks:
1. Clone the repository or download the desired notebooks.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab/Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions within each notebook to learn and experiment with deep learning concepts and code.
